# homeeHistoryDownloader

This short Script will download all Device History Zip-Files from homee Webapp to your default (Chrome) download directory.

Just download ChromeDriver from http://chromedriver.chromium.org/download 
and change inputs in the Script accordingly (enter your homee ID, username and password).

Then let it do its magic.

##Disclaimer:

I just put this together in a rush. Maybe its not beautiful but it works for me:-)
